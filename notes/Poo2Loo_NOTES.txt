****** first comments TA ***************
ADD features:
speed up poo with timer
+ loo roll = slow down 


*****ISSUES***********

--increase the frequency of the loop without creating too many objects
--fix collision logic : .pop() not working or loop too slow? , objects are all hitting the ground even after they have been caught Â» after a 4-5 loops removed more objects from the array than exist in the game
